### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
The script prompts the user to input a city, month, and day to filter and analyze the bikeshare data. It then loads the data from the corresponding CSV file and applies the specified filters.

The script calculates various statistics and displays them to the user, including the most frequent times of travel, popular stations and trips, trip durations, and user statistics such as user types and, if available, gender and birth year information.

Additionally, the script provides an option to display raw data upon user request.

### Files used
chicago.csv: Contains bikeshare data for the city of Chicago.
new_york_city.csv: Contains bikeshare data for the city of New York City.
washington.csv: Contains bikeshare data for the city of Washington. Gender/Birth year not included. 

These files are loaded into the script using the pd.read_csv() function to analyze and extract insights from the bikeshare data for the specified city, month, and day.
